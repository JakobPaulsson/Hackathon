# Hackathon
My first attempt at creating a game in 24 hours at the Hackathon event

## About the game
The game is a racing game written in pure JavaScript with the help of the canvas element in HTML.

The game is a racing game where the goal is to beat the AI by completing the three laps before the AI.

The map consists of a road, randomly placed rocks, grass and walls. Driving on the road keeps the players speed maximal while driving on the grass slows the player down. Hitting a rock means you have to restart your lap and hitting walls will mirror your angle so that you bounce off the walls.

## Installation
The game can be ran directly in the browser, which means installation only requires running
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JakobPaulsson/Hackathon.git
``` 
to clone the repo. To play the game, open index.html with your favorite browser.
